/**
* Library for reading TSIC digital temperature sensors 20x, 30x, 50x
* using the Arduino platform.
*
* Version 2.3 (by Roman Schmitz, 2016-11-01)
*		- sensor can be operated with external VCC, so no extra pin is neccessary
*		- standard vcc-pin set to 255 (NO_VCC_PIN)
*		- example for external powering
*
* Version 2.2 (by Roman Schmitz, 2016-06-30)
*		- added calculation for 50x sensors
*		- a parameter in the constructor is used to select sensor type, standard is set to 20x/30x for backward compatibility
*		- example was chaged to show usage of sensor types
* 
* Version 2.1 (changes by Matthias Eibl, 2015-03-31)
* 		- if the TSIC returns an error, the Power PIN is 
* 		  turned LOW (otherwise it produces errors as the 
* 		  start for a healthy sensor is not defined properly.)
* 		- the timeouts are optimized for a faster identification of 
* 		  not connected sensors (if no sensor is connected, the 
* 		  Data Pin will remain in state LOW. As the strobe is usually
* 		  ~ 60us, it is sufficient to set the timeout to a value of
* 		  <<100 loops in the second while loop "while (TSIC_LOW){..."
* 		  in the function "TSIC::readSens". One cycle is -depending on
* 		  the CPU frequency used- ~10us.)
* 
* Version 2 (by Rolf Wagner, 2014-03-09)
*		Improvements:
*		- Arduino > 1.0 compatible
*		- corrected offset (about +2Â°C)
*		- code run time optimization
*		- no freezing of system in case sensor gets unplugged
*		- measure strobetime instead of constant waiting time (-> high temperature stable)
*		- code cleanup
*		- space optimization, now only 239 byte
